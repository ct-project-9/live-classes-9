Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command 
line to
assemble an image. Using the docker build, users can create an automated build that executes several
command line instructions in succession.

It depends on some predefined Keywords that has a significant meaning defined by 
Docker for creating Docker applications

============================================================================================

FROM --> The
FROM keyword is used to define the base image, on which we
will be building. (FROM python:latest)

Parent vs Base Image

RUN
The
RUN keyword is used to add layers to the base image,
by installing components. Each RUN statement adds a
new layer to the docker image. 
RUN apt-get update

COPY 
COPY  <source> <destination in container> { no remote download }

ADD
The
ADD keyword is used to add files to the container being built. The
syntax used is:
ADD <source> <destination in container> { also work for remote place and download it}

ENV
The
ENV keyword is used to define environment variables
in the container runtime. ---> DB-HOST= datatbase address , CONFIG = java.xml

EXPOSE PORTNUMBER --- it define which port u want ur conatiner to get the traffic 

WORKDIR app - alternative of cd 
MAKEDIR demo - mkdir

CMD
The
CMD keyword is used to run commands on the start of the
container. These commands run only when there is no argument
specified while running the container. (app.jar  --> java app.jar // python3 app.py)


ENTRYPOINT
The
ENTRYPOINT keyword is used strictly to run commands the
moment the container initializes along with multiple arguments -- java app.jar --xms 20Gb


================================================

===================================

1. Dockerfile

2. docker build . --tag   ---> This build or creates ur Docker Image

3. docker run imagename ----> This will give ur image a life and start running the app u built as container

docker run -it -d --name nginxwebserver1 -p 8083:80 nginx:v2
